Flare's API is available at `https://api.flare.io`.
Requests are authenticated with JSON Web Tokens which can be obtained using an API key.

## Obtaining an API key

Users can generate API keys by visiting the [Profile page](https://app.flare.io/#/profile) under the "API Keys" section.

API keys are associated to a user and will have the same permissions as the user that generated them:
- If you can access a tenant, the API key will have access to that tenant.
- If you are an organization administrator, the API key will have organization administrator access.
