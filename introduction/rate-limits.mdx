## Currently Enforced Rate Limits

API usage exceeding 1 request per second is subject to Flare's API rate limit.
Rate Limits are enforced **per organization**.

Enforced limits receive a `RATELIMIT_REACHED` error message with the status code 429.

<ResponseExample>

```json Example Rate Limit Response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATELIMIT_REACHED"
    "message": "ratelimit reached"
}
```

</ResponseExample>


## Page Sizes

There are multiple Flare API endpoints that don't obey to large page size requests.
Flare APIs can return large documents and this allows ensuring consistent performance.


If you request a page size that is not supported by a given API endpoint, this endpoint will instead return the max authorized size.
