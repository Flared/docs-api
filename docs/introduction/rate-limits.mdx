title: 'Rate Limits'
---


API usage exceeding 1 request per second is subject to Flare's API rate limit.
Rate Limits are enforced **per organization**.

Enforced limits receive a `RATELIMIT_REACHED` error message with the status code 429.

If you receive 429 errors, Flare's recommended course of action is to wait 10 seconds before retrying.

    "message": "ratelimit reached"
