title: "Exporting a Domain's Credentials"
---


Falre's Leaked Credentials API can be used to export a domain's leaked credentials.

This guide will explain how to export all leaked credentials for the example.com domain using the
[leaksdb/identities/by_domain <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/get-by-domain)
endpoint.


## Export Steps

<Steps>

  <Step title="Fetch one page of results">
    Use the `by_domains` endpint to fetch one page of results.

    If this is the first page, you may omit the `from` parameter.

    If the returned page of results is empty, this means that the export is complete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the highest id in the response value">
    The `by_domains` endpoint returns credentials grouped by identity.

    This means that the highest id could be in any of the returned identities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go back to step 1 until the response is empty">
      Using the highest returned credential id, go back to step 1 to fetch the next page.
  </Step>

</Steps>
