Flare's
[Leaked Cookies API <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/post-cookies-search)
allows for searching in cookies matching your domains found in stealer logs.
Integrators may use this API to identify and invalidate sessions before they are taken over.

This will guide will explain how to use the Leaked Cookies API to monitor for newly found cookies and invalidate
their session.

## Prequisites

- Cookie monitoring must be enabled for your tenant. This feature must be activated by Flare Support.
- Access to a mechanism by which you may verify a cookie's validity.
- Access to a mechanism by which you may invalidate a cookie.

## Steps

<Steps>

  <Step title="Fetch one page of results">
    Use the `cookies/_search` endpoint to fetch one page of results.

    If `next` is missing from the response (or is null), this means that you viewed all pages.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify and Invalidate">
    Loop over the response's items to verify the cookie's validity and invalidate the cookie.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ratelimit and go to step 1">
      Wait one second to avoid going over the API rate limit. Then, go back to step 1 to fetch the next page.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Full Project Template

Flare maintains a full project example on Github:
- https://github.com/Flared/cookie-monitoring

It can serve as a starting point to implement automated session revocation in your organization. 

## End-to-End API Example

This is an end-to-end example in Python.
