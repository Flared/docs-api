[Leaked Cookies API <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/post-cookies-search)
allows for searching in cookies matching your domains found in stealer logs.

This will guide will explain how to use the Leaked Cookies API to monitor for newly found cookies and invalidate
their session.

## Prequisites

## Steps

  <Step title="Fetch one page of results">
