title: "Search in All of Flare's Events"
---

Global searches in Flare is exposed through the
[/search <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/v2/endpoints/search/get-search)
endpoint.

This guide details a typical search use case and provides an example for how to impement it.


## Use Case

- Export all chat messages collected by Flare in the last 6 hours that match the `fraud` keyword.
- Save our last page cursor so that we can resume fetching results in a future execution.

## Parameters

To achieve the desired results, the following parameters will be used:

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
| --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| query | fraud | The keyword we are looking for. |
| lite | true | Quickly browse results, but don't ask for the full content. |
| types[] | chat_message | Retrieve only the chat_message events. |
| order | asc | Retrieve results in ascending order so that we can resume fetching in the future. |
| times | `<from_date>@` | Replace `<from_date>` with a timestamp that corresponds to 6 hours ago and don't set anything after the `@` so that we can fetch all results until the current time. |
| sort_by | searchable | Sort results in the order that they have been added to Flare's database. |


## Paging

The search endpoint uses parameters that match the
[Flare standard paging pattern <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/concepts/paging).

- Use the last response's `next` field as the value for the following request's `next` parameter.
- Stop when the returned `next` is empty.


## Fetching new results in future executions

It is possible to save the `next` in a database and use it to resume fetching new results in the future.
However, it is important that future requests use the same parameters for everything else but `next`. Even the time filter.

## End-to-End Examples

These are end-to-end examples in various programming languages.
