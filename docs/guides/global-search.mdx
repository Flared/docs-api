title: 'Global Search'
---

Global searches in Flare is exposed through the
[/search <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/v2/endpoints/search/get-search)
endpoint.

This guide details a typical search use case and provides an example for how to impement it.


## Use Case

- Export all Chat Messages collected by Flare in the last 6 hours that match the `fraud` keyword.
- Save our last page cursor so that we can resume fetching results in a future execution.

## Parameters

To achieve the desired results, the following parameters will be used:

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
| --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| query | fraud | The keyword we are looking for. |
| lite | true | Quickly browse results, but not necessarily export the full content. |
| types[] | chat_message | Retrieve only the chat_message events. |
| order | asc | Retrieve results in ascending order so that we can resume fetching in the future. |
| sort_by | searchable | Sort results in the order that they have been added to Flare's database. |


## Paging

The search endpoint uses parameters that are very similar to but do not exactly match the
[Flares standard paging pattern <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/introduction/paging).

Differences:
- The `next` response field is instead named `search_after`.
- The `from` request parameter is instead named `search_after`.

Other than the naming difference, the function is the same:
- Use the last response's `search_after` field as the value for the following request's `search_after` parameter.
- Stop when the returned `search_after` is empty.

## End-to-End Examples
