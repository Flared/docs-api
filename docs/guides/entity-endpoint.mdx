title: 'Dynamically Manage Identifier Lifecycle and List Events'
---

The entity events endpoint allows for automatically creating an identifier and immediately
listing events related to it.

The newly created identifier will automatically be deleted
afer 30 days, allowing for simple identifier lifecycle management.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial request">
    On the initial request, the entity endpoint will:
    - Create an identifier matching the query
    - Immediately return available results with a `next` token.

    For example, the query ```{ "type": "domain", "domain": "scatterholt.com" }```
    will automatically create a `domain` identifier monitoring `scatterholt.com`.

    If no subsequent requests are made, the newly created identifier will automatically
    be deleted after 30 days.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Subsequent requests">
    Subsequent requests matching the same query will:
    - Push the existing identifier's expiry 30 additional days
    - Return any newly found results.

    Unlike global searches which can only match the data that Flare already has
    in its shared database, these subsequent requests will benefit from targeted
    monitoring because Flare will have been actively looking for new results matching
    the identifier.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expiry">
    If no requests are made for 30 days, the identifier will automatically be generated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why it simplifies identifier lifecycle

The entity endpoint removes the need for creating, managing and deleting identifiers from the Flare platform.

Instead of managing identifiers, integrators may:
- Loop over all entities that they wish to monitor.
- Call the entity endpoint, which will either create identifiers or push forward the expiry of existing ones.
- Extract results.

Identifier deletion is unnecessary. If an entity is not requested for 30 days,
its related identifiers will automatically be deleted.
