<Update label="2024-12" description="API - December 2024">
  The [cookies search endpoint](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/post-cookies-search) now
  returns an `uuid` that can be used to uniquely identify cookies.

  The [cookies search endpoint](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/post-cookies-search) now
  returns an `imported_at` timestamp that indicates when the cookie was imported to Flare's
  database. It also has a new `imported_after` filter that allows for retrieving cookies
  that were imported after a given timestamp. The
  [Cookie Monitoring Guide <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/guides/cookie-monitoring).

<Update label="2024-10-22" description="Python SDK - v0.1.25">
  Released version 0.1.25 of the
  [Python SDK](/sdk/python).

  This release fixes an issue with packaging that caused the Python SDK to
  declare too many Python dependencies, conflicting with libraries installed
  in the environments of some users.

  The following command can be used to upgrade:
  ```shell
  pip install flareio>=0.1.25
  ```
