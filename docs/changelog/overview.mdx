  [Flare API Event Types <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/event-types/overview).
</Update>

<Update label="2025-08" description="API - August 2025">
  API endpoints using the `/leaksdb/` prefix were changed to `/astp/`.
  The old prefix remains available as an alias and there are no plans to deprecate it.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-07" description="MCP - July 2025">
  Released the
  [Flare API Documentation MCP Server <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/sdk/mcp).

  This is useful for developers building Flare API automations with AI-powered integrated development environments (IDE).
</Update>

<Update label="2025-07" description="API - July 2025">
  The [/leaksdb/credentials <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/get-credentials-v1)
  and [/leaksdb/v2/credentials <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/get-credentials-v2)
  endpoints were marked as deprecated and should be replaced by
  [/astp/v2/credentials/_search <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/astp/endpoints/post-credentials-search).
</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-15" description="Python SDK - v1.0.0">
  Released version 1.0.0 of the
  [Python SDK <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/sdk/python).

  This release contains no changes, it simply marks 1.0.0 so that future
  breaking changes can be communicated using semantic versioning.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-05" description="API - May 2025">
  Added a new
  [List Credentials Within a Tenant <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/guides/tenant-credentials)
  guide.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-04" description="API - April 2025">
  Released a new version of the List All Credentials endpoint,
  [List All Credentials V2 <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/get-credentials-v2),
  which supports the
  [Flare standard paging pattern <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/concepts/paging).

  The old endpoint is still supported and was marked as deprecated:
  [List All Credentials V1 <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/get-credentials-v1).
</Update>

<Update label="2025-02-18" description="Python SDK - v0.2.1">
  Released version 0.2.1 of the
  [Python SDK <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/sdk/python).

  This release adds a `from_env` method to `FlareApiClient`.

  This allows the creation of a client from the following environment variables:
  - `FLARE_API_KEY="<key>"`
  - `FLARE_TENANT_ID="<tenant_id>"`

  Then, the client can be created using:
```python
from flareio import FlareApiClient

client = FlareApiClient.from_env()
```

  The following command can be used to upgrade:
  ```shell
  pip install flareio>=0.2.1
  ```
</Update>

<Update label="2025-01" description="API - January 2025">
  Modified the
  [retrieve event <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/v2/endpoints/activities/get-activities-)
  endpoint to accept the UID as a query parameter instead of as path parameters.
  This avoids confusion that some users had when using uids that have multiple slashes.
  The old endpoint with path parameters was kept for backwards compatibility.

  Increased
  [basic rate limiting <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/concepts/rate-limits-and-quotas)
  from 2 requests per second to 4 requests per second.
</Update>

<Update label="2024-12" description="API - December 2024">
  The
  [cookies search endpoint <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/astp/endpoints/post-cookies-search)
  now returns an `uuid` that can be used to uniquely identify cookies.

  The
  [cookies search endpoint <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/astp/endpoints/post-cookies-search)
  now returns an `imported_at` timestamp that indicates when the cookie was imported to
  Flare's database. It also has a new `imported_after` filter that allows for retrieving
  cookies that were imported after a given timestamp. The
  [Cookie Monitoring Guide <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/guides/cookie-monitoring)
  was updated with an example usage.

  Released new
  [event actions endpoint <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/v4/endpoints/event-actions).
  It allows ignoring, unignoring, remediating and unremediating events.
</Update>

<Update label="2024-10-22" description="Python SDK - v0.1.25">
  Released version 0.1.25 of the
  [Python SDK <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/sdk/python).

  This release fixes an issue with packaging that caused the Python SDK to
  declare too many Python dependencies, conflicting with libraries installed
  in the environments of some users.

  The following command can be used to upgrade:
  ```shell
  pip install flareio>=0.1.25
  ```
</Update>

<Update label="2024-09" description="API - September 2024">
  The API documentation has been revamped for better clarity and structure.

  Weâ€™ve added new [use-case guides <Icon icon="book" size={16} />](/introduction/getting-started)
  to help you quickly address specific customer needs.

  [global search endpoint <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/v4/endpoints/global-search)
  with simpler-to-use filters.

  Released new
  [credentials search endpoint <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/astp/endpoints/post-credentials-search)
