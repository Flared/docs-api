<Note>
The CLI utility is still in beta and is subject to change.
</Note>

Flare publishes a [CLI interface](https://github.com/flared/flareio-cli) for interacting with the Flare API.
It automates basic tasks such exporting events to output files.

## Installing

`flareio-cli` is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flareio-cli/), you can install it using:
```bash
pip install flareio-cli
```

However, we recommend that you invoke it using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Example:
```bash
# Running the last version
uvx flareio-cli --help

# Running a specific version
uvx flareio-cli@version --help
```

You may find all available versions on the Github [releases](https://github.com/Flared/flareio-cli/releases) page.

## Exporting Tenant Events

You may export a tenant's events using the `export-tenant-feed` command:
- The output will be written to `output.txt`.
- The `cursor.txt` file can be used to resume the export from the last place it stopped.

```bash
export FLARE_API_KEY="<api-key>"
uvx run flareio-cli export-tenant-feed \
    --cursor-file=cursor.txt \
    --output-file=output.txt \
    --from-date=2025-01-01
```
