The `paste` event type corresponds to public text pastes found on paste sites such as *Pastebin*, *JustPaste.it*, *YamCode*, or similar sharing services.
These entries typically contain raw text dumps, links to leaked data, code snippets, or communication content,  sometimes referencing or re-hosting credential leaks.
