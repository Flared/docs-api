The `listing` type represents marketplace product advertisements sourced from dark web or illicit online markets.
Each record captures a single product post, including its title, description, seller information, price, and shipping regions.
Listings can refer to drugs, malware, guides, digital goods, counterfeit items, or stolen data, depending on the source market.
