The `bucket` type represents publicly exposed cloud storage containers, such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage buckets.
These records document information about misconfigured or accessible cloud storage endpoints, including domain names, providers, and discovered files.

This type includes `bucket_object`, representing individual files (objects) discovered within publicly exposed cloud storage buckets.
Each record identifies a single accessible object, typically containing metadata like its bucket location, provider, file path, and exposure source.
