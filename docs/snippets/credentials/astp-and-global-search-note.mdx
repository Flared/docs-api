<Note>
Flare supports searching in credentials via two endpoints:
- The [Global Credentials Search endpoint <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/v4/endpoints/credentials-global-search): This endpoint counts towards your global search quota.
- The [ASTP Credentials Search Endpoint <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/astp/endpoints/post-credentials-search): This endpoint does <b>not</b> count towards your search quota but requires ASTP to be enabled on your account. For more information about ASTP, contact your Customer Success Manager.
