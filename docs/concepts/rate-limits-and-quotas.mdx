## Rate Limits

API usage exceeding 1 request per second is subject to Flare's API rate limit.
Rate Limits are enforced **per organization**.

Enforced limits receive a `RATELIMIT_REACHED` error message with the status code 429.

If you receive 429 errors, Flare's recommended course of action is to wait 10 seconds before retrying.

<ResponseExample>

```json Example Rate Limit Response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATELIMIT_REACHED",
    "message": "ratelimit reached"
  }
}
```

</ResponseExample>


## Quotas
API users are responsible for monitoring their Global Search API usage and ensuring it remains within their allocated monthly quota.
  
Each response includes `X-Flare-Global-Searches-Remaining`: The number of API calls remaining in your monthly allocation.

To avoid service interruptions or missed events, we recommend implementing proactive monitoring of your usage.
