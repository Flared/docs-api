## Rate Limits

API usage is subject to Flare's API rate limit.
Rate Limits are enforced **per organization**.

Calls to certain resources have differing independant limits as follows:
- Basic: 4 requests per second
- Search: 1 request per second

For example, a user may perform a total of 5 requests per second, four basic requests and one search request.

Any endpoint that is not subject to basic limit will be identified as such.

Enforced limits receive a `RATELIMIT_REACHED` error message with the status code 429.

If you receive 429 errors, Flare's recommended course of action is to wait 10 seconds before retrying.

<ResponseExample>

```json Example Rate Limit Response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATELIMIT_REACHED",
    "message": "ratelimit reached"
  }
}
```

</ResponseExample>


## Quotas
API users are responsible for monitoring their Global Search usage and ensuring it remains within their allocated monthly quota.

Users with account administration rights can also view their Global Search monthly usage by logging into the platform and navigating to [the tenants page](https://app.flare.io/#/tenants).

Moreover, each global search response includes the `X-Flare-Global-Searches-Remaining` header, indicating the number of searches remaining in your monthly allocation.

When you reach the maximum number of results for a search, the response includes the `X-Flare-Global-Searches-Batch-Reached` header. Performing another search afterward will trigger a quota increase.

To avoid service interruptions or missed events, we recommend implementing proactive monitoring of your usage.

For additional information, please refer to [Global Search Quota](https://docs.flare.io/global-search-quota).
