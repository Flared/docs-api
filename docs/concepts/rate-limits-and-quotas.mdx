## Rate Limits

API usage exceeding 1 request per second is subject to Flare's API rate limit.
Rate Limits are enforced **per organization**.

Enforced limits receive a `RATELIMIT_REACHED` error message with the status code 429.

If you receive 429 errors, Flare's recommended course of action is to wait 10 seconds before retrying.

```json Example Rate Limit Response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATELIMIT_REACHED",
    "message": "ratelimit reached"
  }
}
```

</ResponseExample>


## Quotas
API users are responsible for monitoring their Global Search API usage and ensuring it remains within their allocated monthly quota.

Users with account administration rights can also view their Global Search API monthly calls by logging into the platform and navigating to [the tenants page](https://app.flare.io/#/tenants).  

Moreover, each global search response includes `X-Flare-Global-Searches-Remaining`, indicating the number of API calls remaining in your monthly allocation.

To avoid service interruptions or missed events, we recommend implementing proactive monitoring of your usage.
