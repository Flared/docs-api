The `blog_post` type represents blog-style documents and text-based publications that have been discovered and indexed by Flare across document-sharing or content-hosting platforms such as Scribd, Medium, or public paste/document repositories.
These records generally include technical manuals, guides, or articles that are accessible to the public, potentially containing sensitive, proprietary, or copyrighted materials.
