Flare's
[Leaked Cookies API <Icon icon="code" size={16} />](/api-reference/leaksdb/endpoints/post-cookies-search)
allows you to search for cookies matching your domains found in stealer logs.
Integrators can use this API to identify and invalidate sessions before they are taken over.

This guide will explain how to use the Leaked Cookies API to monitor for newly found cookies and invalidate
their sessions.

## Prerequisites

- Cookie monitoring must be enabled for your tenant. This feature must be activated by Flare Support.
- Access to a mechanism for verifying cookie validity.
- Access to a mechanism for invalidating cookies.

## Steps

<Steps>

  <Step title="Fetch one page of results">
    Use the `cookies/_search` endpoint to fetch one page of results.

    An empty page of results indicates that you have viewed all cookies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify and Invalidate">
    Loop through the response's items to verify each cookie's validity and invalidate it if necessary.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rate Limit and Repeat">
      Wait one second to avoid exceeding the API rate limit. Then, return to step 1 to fetch the next page.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Full Project Template

Flare maintains a complete project example on GitHub:
- https://github.com/Flared/cookie-monitoring

This template can serve as a starting point for implementing automated session revocation in your organization. 

## End-to-End API Example

This end-to-end example demonstrates implementation in Python.
